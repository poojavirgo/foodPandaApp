# CTEC3905 lecture slides

The so-called 'splash' system stores and presents slides used in **CTEC3905:** *Front-end web development*.

The slides can be accessed as a live system on [github pages](https://ctec3905-2022.github.io/lecture-slides/).
The first slideshow is an index of the slideshows for each week.

> The system is called `splash` for historical reasons.
It was **originally** designed as a simple splash screen to add to the beginning and end of videos with the module name and video title.
However, it quickly evolved into what you see here.

If you are interested in how it works, I recorded myself developing the system from nothing.
The videos are available on the CTEC3905 blackboard.

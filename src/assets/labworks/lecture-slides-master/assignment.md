### Assignment

<p class="flex-center">
	Dr Graeme Stuart
</p>

-----
## Brief

<div class="larger"></div>

<div class="hero">
	You will create a website of no more than 4 separate pages (4 distinct screen sections for Single-Page Apps) on a topic of your choice (e.g. portfolio, business, interests, game reviewsâ€¦). This can be useful for your future and should demonstrate your knowledge of all three front-end languages.
</div>

## Marking criteria
<div class="large"></div>


The assignment will be marked on **20 criteria**.
Each criterion will be given one of the following marks:

- **Not addressed** (scores 0%)
- **Partially addressed** (scores 2.5%)
- **Fully addressed** (scores 5%)

For a **total potential mark of 100%** (20 x 5%).

The remainder of this presentation is a run down of the recommended order in which you consider the criteria when reviewing your site.

-----

## Get the basics right

These are pretty **easy to get** but also **have knock on effects** if don't get them right.
There is no real excuse for missing out on these marks.

You should **invest the time** to ensure as close to full marks as possible from these elements of the assignment.

- Source **code on GitHub** classroom
- Tidy file and folder organisation with **lower-case filenames**
- Consistent code **nesting** and **indentation** (2 spaces is industry-standard)
- **Valid** HTML5 and CSS3 source code throughout
- Basic readme.md file with references in markdown format

Getting these **five essential elements** wrong can cost you up to 25% of your potential mark directly (and much more indirectly).

-----

## Good practice

These elements are **crucial** good practice and are easy to check.
Make sure you have addressed these as fully as possible.

- **Regular commits**, not all in the last few days
- Brief, informative **commit messages**
- Separate .css and .js files (e.g. **no style="" or onclick="" attributes in HTML**)
- **CSS layout** of HTML5 elements (e.g. no `<table>` or `<br>` tags for layout)
- No **JavaScript errors** in the browser console
- **ES6 syntax** (e.g. "let" and "const" over "var", template literals, arrow functions)

With the basics, this takes you to a potential total mark of 55%.
Doing well to this point should ensure a pass mark.

-----

## Produce an accessible and interactive site

<div class="large"></div>

Your HTML documents need to be accessible to screen readers and your site should be accessible to users.

- **Web accessibility** (e.g. semantic elements, alt attributes, heading structure, etc.)
- Responsive at any size with **mobile-first** CSS breakpoints
- Well-ordered **information architecture**, ease of navigation at all sizes

This is the stuff that makes your site actually usable.
The experience should meet a minimum quality, no matter what device is being used.

-----

## Your design

<div class="larger"></div>

Now, make it beautiful and add some interactions to make it feel nice to use.

- Coherence of **overall design** - colour, content, styles, etc.
- Use of JavaScript for **DOM manipulation and/or interaction**
- Use of **CSS3 features** (e.g. flexbox, animations, CSS grid)

-----

## More advanced stuff

<div class="larger"></div>

**Only** spend effort on these if you have already addressed everything else.

- **DRY code** (i.e. no repeated similar functions without parameters)
- Use of **GIT branches** for feature development
- Use of JavaScript to **handle data** (e.g. JSON from an external API)
